# DCC-P2P-BlockChain-Chat
An implementation of a toy P2P Blockchain distributed protocol node. It essentially keeps a distributed message archive, with "transactions" (message additions) being validated with MD5 hashes, that must be mined for each message.
Think mini-bitcoin.
Strictly IPv4, because IPv6 is too much work :D.


Extreme level of commenting, because it's a university assignment, so why not.
